# Weather Analysis - Overall Observations

## Temperature Variation

As anticipated, there is a noticeable temperature difference between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In the Northern Hemisphere, temperatures decrease as latitude increases (moving towards the North Pole), while in the Southern Hemisphere, temperatures tend to increase with higher latitudes.

## Humidity and Cloudiness

Latitude does not appear to exert a strong influence on humidity or cloudiness in the analyzed cities. The observed positive correlations are weak, suggesting that latitude alone may not be a significant predictor of these weather variables.

## Wind Speed

Latitude demonstrates a weak influence on wind speed, with a slight positive correlation in the Northern Hemisphere and a slight negative correlation in the Southern Hemisphere. This implies that latitude alone is not a robust predictor of wind speed.

## Notes

- The analysis relies on linear regression models, assuming a linear relationship between variables. Other unconsidered factors may contribute to the observed weather patterns.
- Scatter plots and regression lines serve as visual aids to represent relationships, with the R-value providing quantification of strength and direction of these relationships.
